### Description

**Layout Music Box** is an example of adaptive layout make by me.

- [x] ***There are two pages: the main page and the artists page.***  
You can switch between them in the menu in the site header.

- [x] ***This is a site with adaptive layout.***  
I used **header, footer, main** tags. As well as **section, article** tags.  
I didnâ€™t forget about the **alt** property for describing pictures.

- [x] ***There are two designs implemented here - mobile and desktop.***  
The transition between them is smooth, implemented using media queries.

- [x] ***I tested this site using different browsers and in-browser dev tools.***  
Also used the online tool - browserstack.com
